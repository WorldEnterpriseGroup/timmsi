### 1. **Clear Your Workspace**
1. Open a new tab to be used for research on your favorite Search Engine _(Tab 1)_

### 4. **Project Discovery**
If the entire project has been put in motion well, then there will be a master Readme.md file explaining what this project is with proper links on it. Also, if the person who made the issue you chose tried really hard, then they will have supplied a lot of links and instructions right in the issue.  That is usually not the case.  Usually, you're going to have to try really hard to really understand what the issue is even referring to.  This means you will need to do **Project Discovery** to see if you will have fun and can even comprehend the issue you've chosen.  If it doesn't make sense, you can always comment and ask for clarification before you start an issue & ask the manager to communicate better.<br>
To tackle Project Discovery yourself, do the following:
   1. On the Issue Page, Ctrl-Click the `<> Code` Button in the upper-left area of the Issue you have chosen.
   2. Right-Click the newly created GitHub Code Browser _(Tab 4)_
   3. Choose "Duplicate Tab" which will make a new GitHub Code Browser _(Tab 5)_
   4. If Possible, click the `master` Button and click on **gh-pages** in the selected options (Sometimes not available)
   5. Search the Readme.md to find out the website link.
   6. Either Ctrl-Click the Website link, or open a new tab and browse to it if it's not clickable. _(Tab 6)_
